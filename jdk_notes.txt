A* Notes
--------

You need the correct JDK for MATLAB.  This can be found by typing "version -java" on the MATLAB command prompt.

Compile the .java file with "javac <name>.java"

In MATLAB, add the location of the resulting .class file with:

javaaddpath(<location to .class file>)

Now the class can be used!
